### **Refined Problem Statement**

The core friction within the Prompt Engineering Library (PEL) originates from a single architectural flaw: **the conflation of reusable patterns with specific project implementations.**

This manifests in three cascading problem statements:

1.  **The Governance Problem:** A monolithic governance model (`Makefile`, `PEL_BLUEPRINT.md`) at the root imposes the specific, high-complexity needs of one project onto all others, creating a "one-size-fits-all" system that is confusing, inefficient, and stifles modular growth.
2.  **The Reusability Problem:** Without a formal concept of "templates," there is no clean mechanism to reuse successful architectural patterns (like the structure of a good coding domain) for new projects without manual copy-pasting and cleanup, which inevitably leads to architectural drift and inconsistency.
3.  **The Scoping Problem:** Core assets like base personas (`BTAA-1`) and orchestrators (`PEL-OC-1`) lack a clear architectural "home," making them appear globally applicable when their context is, in fact, specific to a certain type of work, causing confusion about their purpose and applicability.
