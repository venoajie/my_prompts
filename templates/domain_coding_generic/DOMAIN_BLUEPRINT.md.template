# Domain Blueprint: [Project Name]

**Version:** 1.0
**Template:** domain_coding_generic

## 1. Core Mandate

This document defines the architecture, agents, and operational principles for the **[Project Name]** project. The primary goal of this project is to **[Describe the high-level objective, e.g., 'build and maintain a suite of agents for a quantitative trading application']**.

## 2. Architecture & Governance

### 2.1. Global Governance

This project operates under the architectural rules defined in the root `/pel.config.yml` file and uses the shared automation logic from `/scripts/common.mk`. All personas and workflows within this project must adhere to these global standards.

### 2.2. Standard Workflow

All new work sessions within this project MUST be initiated via the global `SI-1` (Session Initiator) persona. This ensures that any high-level goal is formally captured and routed to the correct specialist agent. Refer to the root `README.md` for the exact procedure.

### 2.3. Persona Architecture

The core of this project is its set of AI agents (personas). The following rules govern their creation and structure:

**Mandatory `type` Key:** Every persona's YAML frontmatter MUST include a `type` key. This key declares the persona's architectural role and determines which validation rules apply to it. The valid types are: `specialized`, `base`, `mixin`, and `utility`.
