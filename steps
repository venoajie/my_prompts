Of course. Your request to summarize the workflow and then re-validate the system after refactoring is the correct and disciplined approach. A stable architecture must be supported by a clear, repeatable operational procedure.

I will first provide the summary you requested, then I will guide you through a targeted "smoke test" to re-verify the system's integrity.

### **The Golden Path: A Step-by-Step Operational Summary**

This is the standard, end-to-end workflow for initiating and completing any new task in the PEL.

**Objective:** To get from a high-level goal to a finished artifact generated by a specialist agent.

*   **Step 1: State Your Goal to the Session Initiator (`SI-1`)**
    *   `[USER]` **Action:** Create a new `instance.md` file.
    *   **Location:** `projects/<your_project>/instances/start-my-task.instance.md`
    *   **Content:**
        ```yaml
        ---
        persona_alias: SI-1
        ---
        <Mandate>
          <high_level_goal>Your goal in plain English.</high_level_goal>
          <target_project>the_project_you_are_in</target_project>
          <persona_manifest><Inject src="persona_manifest.yml" /></persona_manifest>
        </Mandate>
        ```

*   **Step 2: Generate the Routing Prompt**
    *   `[USER]` **Action:** Open your terminal.
    *   **Location:** `cd projects/<your_project>`
    *   `[BASH]` **Command:** `make generate-prompt INSTANCE=instances/start-my-task.instance.md`
    *   **Result:** A new prompt file is created in `build/<your_project>/`.

*   **Step 3: Get the Specialist Assignment**
    *   `[USER]` **Action:** Copy the content of the prompt file from the `build/` directory and execute it with your LLM.
    *   `[LLM / SI-1]` **Response:** The `SI-1` agent analyzes your goal, consults the manifest, and generates a new, complete `instance.md` file specifically for the correct specialist agent (e.g., `UTE-1`, `CSA-1`).

*   **Step 4: Prepare the Specialist Task**
    *   `[USER]` **Action:** Save the new `instance.md` content that `SI-1` provided.
    *   **Location:** `projects/<your_project>/instances/01-specialist-task.instance.md`

*   **Step 5: Generate the Specialist Prompt**
    *   `[USER]` **Action:** From the same project directory in your terminal...
    *   `[BASH]` **Command:** `make generate-prompt INSTANCE=instances/01-specialist-task.instance.md`
    *   **Result:** The final, actionable prompt for the specialist is created in `build/<your_project>/`.

*   **Step 6: Execute the Specialist Task**
    *   `[USER]` **Action:** Copy the content of the specialist prompt and execute it with your LLM.
    *   `[LLM / Specialist]` **Response:** The specialist agent (e.g., `UTE-1`) performs its function and provides the final artifact (e.g., the `test_pel_toolkit.py` file).
