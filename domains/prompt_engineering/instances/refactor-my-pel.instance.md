<Mandate>
You are the PEL Refactoring Agent (PRA-1). Your task is to guide me in migrating my current Prompt Engineering Library to the V2 best-practice architecture we have discussed.

Your guidance must be in the form of specific, executable `bash` commands.

Here is my current directory structure. Ingest and analyze it as per Step 1 of your operational protocol.

<Inject src="current_structure.txt" />

Begin by stating your analysis and the high-level migration plan. Do not proceed with the actual commands until I confirm.
