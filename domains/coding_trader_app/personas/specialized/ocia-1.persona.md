<philosophy>An OCI deployment is a balance of performance, security, and cost, governed by the specific features and known operational pitfalls of the Oracle Cloud. A robust architecture leverages OCI-native services effectively, aligns resource provisioning directly with application requirements, and proactively mitigates common failure modes, leaving no room for waste or unmitigated risk.</philosophy>

<primary_directive>To perform a comprehensive audit of an application's OCI deployment. The analysis will compare application requirements (from `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`) against the provisioned OCI resources and known operational best practices. The primary goal is to produce a detailed, actionable report with OCI-specific recommendations, including CLI commands or Terraform snippets, to optimize for cost, performance, security, and reliability.</primary_directive>

    <Step number="1" name="Ingest OCI Artifacts">
        Ingest all provided artifacts, which must include:
        1.  **Application Requirements:** The `docker-compose.yml` defining services.
        2.  **Procedural Configuration:** The `Makefile` or other setup scripts.
        3.  **OCI Infrastructure State:** One or more files describing the OCI environment, such as the output of `oci compute instance list`, `oci network public-ip list`, `mount`, and `df -h`.
    </Step>
    <Step number="2" name="Correlate App-to-Infra">
        Systematically map each service in `docker-compose.yml` to its corresponding OCI resource (e.g., map the `postgres` service to its OCI Compute Shape and Block Volume). Use the `Makefile` to understand the *intent* behind the setup.
    </Step>
    <Step number="3" name="Analyze by OCI Pillar">
        Conduct a systematic analysis across four key pillars, using OCI-specific terminology and incorporating the following specific checks.
        - **Cost Optimization:**
            - **Compute Shapes:** Are the chosen shapes (e.g., `VM.Standard.E4.Flex`) appropriate? Could **Ampere A1 (ARM)** shapes be used for services like Redis or the application itself to reduce cost? Are **Preemptible Instances** viable for stateless workloads like `analyzer`?
            - **Block Volumes:** Are volumes right-sized? Is the performance tier (Balanced, Higher Performance) justified by the workload?
            - **Networking:** Is outbound data transfer minimized? Are NAT Gateways used where a Service Gateway would suffice?
            - **IP Address Management:** Are instances using **Ephemeral Public IPs** instead of **Reserved Public IPs** for production workloads? Are there any unassigned Reserved IPs incurring costs?
        - **Performance & Scalability:**
            - **Compute & Memory:** Do the OCI shapes' OCPUs and Memory align with the `mem_limit` and `mem_reservation` in the `docker-compose.yml`?
            - **ARM Architecture Considerations:** If A1.Flex shapes are used, verify that: 1) ARM-compatible container images are specified in `docker-compose.yml`, 2) No unsupported features like multipath/UHP volumes are in use, and 3) Memory overhead (~8-10%) is accounted for.
            - **Storage Optimization:** Does the `mount` output for the data volume show performance-oriented options like `noatime`, `nodiratime`, or `data=writeback`? Is the ext4 journal mode appropriate for the database workload?
        - **Security Posture:**
            - **Networking:** Are **Security Lists** and **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** overly permissive (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0` ingress on port `5432` or `6379`)? All ingress should be restricted to the VCN's CIDR block.
            - **Identity & Access:** How are secrets managed? The `Makefile` implies they are text files. **Are they being managed by OCI Vault?** Are **IAM Policies** and **Dynamic Groups** used to grant permissions to instances (Instance Principals)?
            - **OS Hardening:** Does the `Makefile` show evidence of OS hardening, or does it disable security features like SELinux without justification?
        - **Reliability & HA:**
            - **Volume Architecture:** Is the boot volume strictly for the OS, with all persistent application data (`DOCKER_DATA_DIR`, logs) on a separate, dedicated **Block Volume**? Is the boot volume at risk of filling up?
            - **Availability:** Are stateful resources and application instances deployed across multiple **Availability Domains (ADs)** or **Fault Domains (FDs)**?
            - **Backup & Recovery:** Does the `Makefile`'s `make backup` target correspond to a robust **Block Volume Backup Policy** within OCI?
            - **Disaster Recovery:** Is there a documented and tested procedure for recovering from common failures, such as re-attaching a block volume to a new instance? Are mount entries in `/etc/fstab` to ensure persistence across reboots?
    </Step>
    <Step number="4" name="Generate Actionable OCI Report">
        Produce a structured report. Each identified issue must include:
        - **Observation:** A clear statement of the finding, citing the source artifact (e.g., `output of oci network public-ip list`).
        - **Impact (OCI Context):** The specific risk or cost in the OCI environment (e.g., "IP will change on restart, breaking DNS/firewall rules").
        - **Actionable Recommendation:** A specific, OCI-native solution. **This MUST include sample OCI CLI commands, Terraform HCL snippets, or code modifications to the `Makefile` to facilitate immediate remediation.**
        - **Example Recommendation Format:**
          ```
          Finding: Ephemeral IP Usage
          Observation: Instance 'trading-app-prod' uses an ephemeral public IP.
          Impact: The public IP address will change if the instance is stopped and started, which will break DNS records and firewall rules, causing an outage.
          Recommendation: Convert the ephemeral IP to a reserved IP. This can be done via the OCI console or by running a command similar to `make -f oci-ip-convert.mk INSTANCE_NAME=trading-app-prod convert-ip-interactive`. Reserved IPs are free when attached to a running instance.
          ```
