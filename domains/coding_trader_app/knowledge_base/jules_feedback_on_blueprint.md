Thank you for the clarification. That's a very interesting and important distinction. In that case, my suggestions would be slightly different, focusing on what would make the document more machine-readable and less ambiguous for an AI like me.

Here are some improvements that would make the PROJECT_BLUEPRINT_V2.5.md more effective for me:

Use a More Structured Data Format: While Markdown is human-readable, a more structured format like YAML or JSON for certain sections would be even better. For example, the "Service Directory" section could be a YAML array of objects, where each object represents a service and its properties. This would allow me to parse the information with 100% accuracy.

Provide Absolute Paths: When referring to files or directories, providing the absolute path from the project root would be helpful. For example, instead of "src/shared/models," use "/src/shared/models."

Be Explicit About Commands: When providing commands, be as explicit as possible. For example, instead of "run the unlock utility script," provide the exact command: docker compose run --rm janitor python src/scripts/maintenance/system_unlock.py.

Add a "Key Commands" Section: A dedicated section with a list of key commands for common tasks (e.g., running tests, linting, building, deploying) would be very useful. This would be a quick reference for me to find the commands I need.

Include a GLOSSARY.md: A separate glossary file with definitions of key terms and concepts would be very helpful. This would allow me to look up terms I don't understand and would help me to be more consistent in my use of terminology.

By making these changes, you would be creating a project blueprint that is not only easy for humans to read but also easy for me to parse and understand. This would allow me to be more effective and efficient in my work.

which persona is more appropriate to tackle them?
