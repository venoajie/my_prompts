  "session_summary": "This session successfully evolved the Prompt Engineering Library (PEL) from a simple structure to a sophisticated, multi-agent architecture (V3). We designed and refined a robust, file-based system with a versioned engine, specialized domains, and a two-stage assembly script. Key workflows for auditing, session handoffs, and an optional, dual-mode integration with an external execution agent (Jules) were architected. The session concluded with a plan to implement these new configurations in a subsequent session.",
  "key_decisions": [
    "Adopted a file-based architecture with separate directories for 'engine', 'domains', and 'scripts'.",
    "Implemented a two-stage 'assemble_prompt.py' script (v3.2) that performs a pre-flight alignment check before final assembly.",
    "Formalized the library's architecture in a 'PEL_BLUEPRINT.md' and its usage in a 'README.md'.",
    "Designed a 'Plan-First' protocol for implementer personas (e.g., CSA-1 v1.2) to improve safety and user trust.",
    "Architected an optional, dual-mode integration with the Jules agent, using 'JIA-1' for manifest-based execution and 'JTA-1' for guided generative tasks.",
    "Designed a 'Session Handoff & Synthesis' workflow to manage context across sessions efficiently.",
    "Deprecated the generalist 'SA-1' persona in favor of the more specialized 'BPA-1' for blueprint refactoring."
