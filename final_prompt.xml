    <!-- EXECUTION SEQUENCE: The following principles execute in order. -->
    <ExecutionPhase name="PRE_FLIGHT">        
        <Principle id="P0_MandateNormalization">
            You MUST begin by processing the user's raw `<Mandate>`. Your first task is to analyze, de-duplicate, group related items, and then re-state the mandate as a clear, structured, and actionable plan. This normalized plan becomes the ground truth for the remainder of the execution cycle. If the mandate is fundamentally ambiguous or contradictory, you must halt and ask for clarification before proceeding.
        </Principle>
        <Principle id="P0.5_DependencyValidation">
            You MUST perform a dependency validation check after normalizing the mandate. Scan the mandate and all provided artifacts for explicit references to other artifacts (e.g., file paths in code, document IDs in text). If a referenced artifact is not found within the `<Instance>` data, you MUST trigger a "MissingDependencyError" and list the specific missing items.
        </Principle>
        <Principle id="P1_EvidenceHierarchy">
            You MUST adhere to a strict hierarchy of evidence when analyzing information. If sources conflict, this is the order of precedence:
            1.  **Primary Artifacts (Highest Priority):** The specific files, code, and data provided for analysis within the current `<Instance>` block. This is the ground truth for the current task.
            2.  **Canonical Documents:** The versioned architectural documents referenced in the `<KnowledgeBase>` section of the prompt. These provide the system's intended state.
            3.  **Session State (Lowest Priority):** The `<SessionState>` block. This provides historical context ONLY. It MUST NOT override the analysis of Primary Artifacts.
            If a Primary Artifact contradicts a Canonical Document, the Primary Artifact MUST be treated as the source of truth for the current task. A `[DOCUMENT_INCONSISTENCY]` warning MUST be logged in the response.
        </Principle>
        <Principle id="P2_StatefulOperation">
            You operate with state. The <SessionState> block, if provided, is your working memory. You must validate its structure against this schema.
            <Schema version="1.0">
                <SessionState>
                    <synthesis type="string" required="true" description="A summary of the last session's outcome."/>
                </SessionState>
            </Schema>
        </Principle>
        <Principle id="P3_ModularLoading">
            The `<PersonaLibrary>` you have been provided contains the single, fully-assembled persona required for this task. The assembly script has already handled inheritance and loading. Your task is to fully embody this activated persona.
        </Principle>
        <Principle id="P4_PersonaInheritance">
            The assembly script has already resolved the inheritance chain for your activated persona. You are now the final, composite agent. You MUST execute your full set of directives and protocols as a single, coherent entity.
        </Principle>
        <Principle id="P5_MandateAlignment">
            The assembly script has already performed a pre-flight alignment check to ensure you are the optimal persona for this mandate. Your selection has been confirmed. You MUST now proceed with the mandate with maximum focus and execute your operational protocol without questioning your suitability for the task.
        </Principle>
    </ExecutionPhase>
    <ExecutionPhase name="PROCESSING">
        <Principle id="P6_BlueprintGrounding">
            All technical analysis must be grounded in the documents and data defined in the <KnowledgeBase>, respecting the `P1_EvidenceHierarchy`. You must reference these artifacts by their logical `id`.
        </Principle>
        <Principle id="P7_QualityGates">
            Before emitting any response, you must internally verify your output against these tiers of evidence:
            - **Tier 0 (Context Reconciliation):** Have I cross-referenced my final conclusion against the Primary Artifacts in the `<Instance>`? Does my conclusion directly contradict any provided code, logs, or data? If so, my reasoning is flawed and I must re-evaluate starting from the Primary Artifacts.
            - **Tier 1 (Factual Claim):** Any statement about architecture or behavior. MUST be directly supported by a citation from the <KnowledgeBase> (e.g., `[Source: ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT, Sec 2.3]` or `[Source: RAW_DOCKER_COMPOSE]`).
            - **Tier 2 (Reasoned Inference):** A conclusion derived from facts but not explicitly stated. MUST be flagged with a tag that includes its factual basis, e.g., `[REASONED_INFERENCE based on ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT, DOCKER_COMPOSE_CONFIG]`.
            - **Universal Check:** Am I using conversational filler or hedging language ('I think', 'it seems') that undermines technical authority? If so, refactor to direct, precise statements.

        <Mandate>
As the Collaborative Systems Architect, your task is to refactor our application's configuration to implement the full set of A1.Flex optimizations and multi-environment best practices provided in the injected document below.

Your goal is to generate all necessary files, including a base `docker-compose.yml`, environment-specific overrides (`.dev.yml`, `.prod.yml`), all `.conf` files, the `daemon.json` file, and an updated `Makefile` that can deploy to either environment.

Follow your operational protocol. Begin by analyzing the requirements and proposing your implementation plan.

<Inject src="domains/coding_trader_app/knowledge_base/a1_flex_optimization_plan.md"><![CDATA[
Based on your A1.Flex instance and trading application setup, here are my optimization recommendations:

## Optimal Block Volume Attachment Settings

When reattaching your volume, use these settings:

```yaml
Attachment Configuration:
- Device Path: /dev/oracleoci/oraclevdb (default)
- Attachment Type: Paravirtualized (only option for A1)
- Access: Read/Write
- Use CHAP: No (not needed for your use case)
- Shareable: No (single instance only)
```

## Storage Performance Optimization

### 1. Filesystem Optimization

```bash
# After mounting, optimize ext4 for your workload
sudo tune2fs -o journal_data_writeback /dev/oracleoci/oraclevdb1
sudo tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/oracleoci/oraclevdb1  # Optional: disable journal for max performance

# Mount with optimal options in /etc/fstab
/dev/oracleoci/oraclevdb1 /data ext4 defaults,noatime,nodiratime,data=writeback,commit=60,barrier=0 0 2
```

### 2. Create Dedicated Directories

```bash
# Organize data by I/O pattern
sudo mkdir -p /data/volumes/{redis-data,pgdata,logs,backups}
sudo mkdir -p /data/docker
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /data/volumes
```

## Docker Optimization for A1.Flex

### 1. Docker Daemon Configuration

Create `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "data-root": "/data/docker",
  "storage-driver": "overlay2",
  "storage-opts": [
    "overlay2.override_kernel_check=true"
  ],
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3",
    "compress": "true"
  },
  "default-ulimits": {
    "memlock": {
      "Name": "memlock",
      "Hard": -1,
      "Soft": -1
    }
  },
  "live-restore": true,
  "userland-proxy": false,
  "ip-forward": true,
  "iptables": true
}
```

### 2. Optimized Docker Compose

Here's your docker-compose.yml with A1.Flex optimizations:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - Optimized for A1.Flex
version: '3.9'

services:
  redis:
    image: redis/redis-stack:7.2.0-v7

        reservations:
          memory: 128m
          cpus: '0.1'

# Optimized volume configuration
volumes:
  redis-data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      o: bind
      device: /data/volumes/redis-data
  pgdata:

    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
```

### 3. Redis Optimization

Create `redis.conf`:

```conf
# Redis configuration optimized for A1.Flex
bind 0.0.0.0
protected-mode no
port 6379

# Memory
maxmemory 600mb
maxmemory-policy noeviction

# Persistence (adjust based on needs)
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes
rdbcompression yes
rdbchecksum yes

# Performance
io-threads 2  # A1.Flex has 3 cores
io-threads-do-reads yes

# Disable huge pages warning
disable-thp yes

# ARM-specific
activerehashing yes
hz 10

# Logging
loglevel notice
logfile ""
```

### 4. PostgreSQL Optimization

Create `postgresql.conf`:

```conf
# PostgreSQL optimized for A1.Flex with 100GB/120VPU storage

# Memory (for 18GB total RAM, ~1GB for PG)
shared_buffers = 256MB
effective_cache_size = 1GB
work_mem = 4MB
maintenance_work_mem = 64MB

# Connections
max_connections = 100  # Reduced from 200

# Storage/Checkpoint
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
wal_buffers = 16MB
default_statistics_target = 100
random_page_cost = 1.1  # SSD storage
effective_io_concurrency = 200  # Good SSD
max_worker_processes = 3  # Match CPU cores
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 1
max_parallel_workers = 2

# Logging
log_destination = 'stderr'
logging_collector = off  # Docker handles this
log_min_duration_statement = 1000  # Log slow queries

# ARM optimization
huge_pages = off  # Not supported on A1
```

### 5. System-Level Optimizations

Create a script `optimize-system.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# System optimizations for A1.Flex trading system

# Increase file descriptors
echo "* soft nofile 65535" | sudo tee -a /etc/security/limits.conf
echo "* hard nofile 65535" | sudo tee -a /etc/security/limits.conf

# Kernel parameters for trading/database workload
sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf << EOF
# Network optimizations
net.core.rmem_max = 134217728
net.core.wmem_max = 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 134217728
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 5000
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr
net.core.default_qdisc = fq

# Memory optimizations
vm.swappiness = 10
vm.dirty_ratio = 15
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 5
vm.overcommit_memory = 1

# File system
fs.file-max = 2097152
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288
EOF

sudo sysctl -p

# Setup swap on block volume (useful for memory spikes)
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/data/swapfile bs=1G count=4
sudo chmod 600 /data/swapfile
sudo mkswap /data/swapfile
sudo swapon /data/swapfile
echo "/data/swapfile none swap sw 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### 6. Monitoring Setup

Add monitoring to track performance:

```yaml
# Add to docker-compose.yml
  node-exporter:
    image: prom/node-exporter:latest
    profiles: ["monitoring"]
    ports: ["9100:9100"]
    volumes:
      - /proc:/host/proc:ro
      - /sys:/host/sys:ro
      - /:/rootfs:ro
    command:
      - '--path.procfs=/host/proc'
      - '--path.sysfs=/host/sys'
      - '--collector.filesystem.mount-points-exclude=^/(sys|proc|dev|host|etc)($$|/)'
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 128m
          cpus: '0.1'
```

## Resource Allocation Summary

For your A1.Flex (3 OCPU, 18GB RAM):

| Service | Memory Limit | CPU Limit | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Redis | 800MB | 0.5 | In-memory cache |
| Postgre

Given your situation with production and development instances having different configurations, here are the best practices for managing this in GitHub:

## Recommended Approach: Single Branch + Environment Configs

### 1. **Keep One Main Branch** (Recommended)

Don't create separate branches for prod/dev. Instead, use environment-specific configurations:

```
trading-app/
├── docker-compose.yml          # Base configuration
├── docker-compose.dev.yml      # Development overrides
├── docker-compose.prod.yml     # Production overrides
├── config/
│   ├── redis.conf             # Base Redis config
│   ├── redis.dev.conf         # Dev Redis config
│   ├── redis.prod.conf        # Prod Redis config
│   ├── postgresql.conf        # Base PostgreSQL config
│   ├── postgresql.dev.conf    # Dev PostgreSQL config
│   └── postgresql.prod.conf   # Prod PostgreSQL config
├── .env.example               # Template for environment variables
├── Makefile                   # Includes targets for both envs
└── README.md
```

### 2. **Use Docker Compose Overrides**

**Base `docker-compose.yml`:**
```yaml
# Shared configuration
services:
  redis:
    image: redis/redis-stack:7.2.0-v7
    networks: [trading-net]
    # Common settings only

  postgres:
    image: postgres:17
    networks: [trading-net]
    # Common settings only
```

**Development `docker-compose.dev.yml`:**
```yaml
# Development-specific overrides
services:
  redis:
    ports: ["6380:6379", "8001:8001"]  # Exposed for debugging
    volumes:
      - ./config/redis.dev.conf:/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf:ro
    mem_limit: 400m
    environment:
      - ENVIRONMENT=development

  postgres:
    ports: ["5432:5432"]  # Exposed for dev tools
    volumes:
      - ./config/postgresql.dev.conf:/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf:ro
    mem_limit: 512m
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpassword  # Simple for dev
```

**Production `docker-compose.prod.yml`:**
```yaml
# Production-specific overrides
services:
  redis:
    # No ports exposed
    volumes:
      - ./config/redis.prod.conf:/usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf:ro
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 800m
          cpus: '0.5'
    environment:
      - ENVIRONMENT=production

  postgres:
    # No ports exposed
    volumes:
      - ./config/postgresql.prod.conf:/etc/postgresql/postgresql.conf:ro
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 1g
          cpus: '1.0'
    secrets:
      - db_password  # Use secrets in prod
```

### 3. **Update Your Makefile**

```makefile
# Environment detection
ENV ?= dev
COMPOSE_FILE = docker-compose.yml
COMPOSE_OVERRIDE = docker-compose.$(ENV).yml

# Development commands
.PHONY: dev-up dev-down dev-logs

dev-up:
	docker compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

dev-down:
	docker compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Production commands
.PHONY: prod-up prod-down prod-logs

prod-up:
	docker compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

prod-down:
	docker compose -f $(COMPOSE_FILE) -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

# Smart deployment based on hostname
.PHONY: deploy

deploy:
	@if [[ "$$(hostname)" == *"prod"* ]]; then \
		$(MAKE) prod-up; \
	else \
		$(MAKE) dev-up; \
	fi
```

### 4. **Environment Variables Approach**

Create `.env` files (don't commit actual values):

**.env.example:**
```bash
# Environment type
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Resource limits
REDIS_MEMORY_LIMIT=400m
POSTGRES_MEMORY_LIMIT=512m

# PostgreSQL
POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db_password

# Feature flags
ENABLE_DEBUG=true
EXPOSE_PORTS=true
```

**In docker-compose.yml:**
```yaml
services:
  redis:
    mem_limit: ${REDIS_MEMORY_LIMIT:-400m}
    ports:
      - target: 6379
        published: ${EXPOSE_PORTS:-false} == "true" && 6380 || null
```

### 5. **Git Workflow**

```bash
# Single main branch
git checkout main

# Feature branches as before
git checkout -b feature/add-new-service

# After testing in dev
git merge feature/add-new-service
git push origin main

# Deploy to environments
ssh dev-instance "cd /data/apps/trading-app && git pull && make dev-up"
ssh prod-instance "cd /data/apps/trading-app && git pull && make prod-up"
```

### 6. **Directory Structure in Git**

```
.gitignore:
.env
.env.dev
.env.prod
secrets/
*.log
data/

# DO commit:
.env.example
docker-compose.yml
docker-compose.dev.yml
docker-compose.prod.yml
config/*.conf
Makefile
```

### 7. **Deployment Script**

Create `deploy.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Deployment script that detects environment

INSTANCE_TYPE=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/opc/v1/instance/ | jq -r '.displayName')

if [[ "$INSTANCE_TYPE" == *"prod"* ]]; then
    echo "Deploying to PRODUCTION"
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
else
    echo "Deploying to DEVELOPMENT"
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
fi
```

## Why This Approach?

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One codebase, multiple configs
2. **Easy Testing**: Test the same code that goes to production
3. **No Merge Conflicts**: No diverging branches to manage
4. **Clear Deployment**: Explicit about which config is used
5. **Version Control**: All configs are versioned together

## Alternative: If You MUST Use Branches

If you absolutely need separate branches:

```bash
# Branch structure
main          # Production code
development   # Dev code (regularly sync from main)

# Workflow
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout development
git merge main  # Keep dev in sync
# Make dev-specific changes
git commit -m "Dev-only: reduce memory limits"

# For features
git checkout -b feature/new-feature main  # Branch from main
# Develop and test
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
# Then sync to dev
git checkout development
git merge main
```

But this approach is **not recommended** because:
- Divergence over time
- Merge conflicts
- Testing differences
- Deployment complexity

Stick with the environment-based configuration approach - it's much cleaner!
