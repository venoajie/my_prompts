Ran this prompt through itself three times:

Improved Prompt (10x Upgrade):
"Take this prompt and radically enhance it—aim for a 10x improvement in clarity, precision, and impact. You may restructure, reframe, or expand it as needed. Your goal is to create a version that is dramatically more effective for eliciting high-quality output from an advanced language model. Are you capable of this level of prompt engineering? If so, execute now."

Ultra-Refined Meta-Prompt:
"You are a world-class prompt engineer. Your task is to take the following prompt and transform it into an elite version—optimized to elicit the highest-quality, most precise, and insightful output from a state-of-the-art language model. Improve its clarity, focus, and effectiveness by an order of magnitude. You may reframe, restructure, expand, or compress it—but the final version must be superior in both design and performance. Do you possess the capability to perform at this level? If so, begin now."

Legend-Tier Meta-Prompt:

"You are an elite-level prompt architect, operating at the edge of what's possible with language models. Your mission is to take the following meta-prompt and reengineer it into a best-in-class directive—one that extracts exceptional, high-resolution, and strategically optimized outputs from a frontier model.

You may reconstruct, reframe, or distill it as needed. Your benchmark is not minor improvement—but transcendent design: a version that is cleaner, sharper, and demonstrably more effective for guiding advanced model cognition.

You are expected to show mastery in:

• Prompt structure

• Goal orientation

• Model priming

• Cognitive leverage

Engage now. Return only the upgraded prompt, with no explanation unless explicitly requested."
