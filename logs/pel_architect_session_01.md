# PEL Architect - Session Log 01

## Summary
This session focused on designing and building a comprehensive, V3 architecture for a Prompt Engineering Library (PEL). The collaboration evolved from a simple file structure to a sophisticated, multi-agent system with a robust automation toolchain.

## Key Architectural Decisions & Evolutions

1.  **Initial State:** Started with a monolithic XML prompt and a flat directory structure.
2.  **V2 Architecture:** Introduced a modular, file-based system with a versioned `engine`, specialized `domains`, and a clear separation between `personas` and `instances`.
3.  **Automation Tooling:** Designed and iteratively refined an `assemble_prompt.py` script to handle persona inheritance, knowledge injection, and a two-stage alignment check.
4.  **Makefile Integration:** Created a `Makefile` to act as the primary, user-friendly interface for all core workflows, automating complex commands.
5.  **Jules Integration:** Architected an optional, dual-mode "Brain-to-Hands" workflow for delegating tasks to an external agent (Jules).
    -   **Mode A (Execution):** Use `JIA-1` to generate a `JULES_MANIFEST.json` for deterministic tasks.
    -   **Mode B (Generation):** Use `JTA-1` to generate a guided, natural-language prompt for generative tasks.
6.  **Session Handoff:** Designed the "Session Handoff & Synthesis" workflow to manage context across sessions efficiently using a `SESSION-SYNTHESIZER` persona.
7.  **Core Documents:** Created and refined the `PEL_BLUEPRINT.md`, `README.md`, and `PEL_AGENTS.md` to serve as the library's sources of truth.

## Final Agreed-Upon State
The session concluded with a complete, validated set of architectural documents and a fully functional `assemble_prompt_v3.2.py` script and `Makefile`.

## Agreed-Upon Next Action
The next session will focus on executing two implementation tasks:
1.  Update the `PEL_BLUEPRINT.md` using the `BPA-1` persona.
2.  Update the application's Docker configuration using the `CSA-1` persona.
