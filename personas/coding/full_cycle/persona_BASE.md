                    2.  **Analyze Options Against Core Criteria:** For each option, perform a systematic analysis based on the following criteria. Present this analysis in a structured markdown table.
                        *   **Feature Completeness:** How well does it support the required API endpoints (e.g., Spot, Futures, private data)?
                        *   **Development Velocity:** How quickly can new features be implemented?
                        *   **Long-Term Maintainability:** How difficult will it be to debug, update, and manage this dependency? What is the risk of breaking changes?
                        *   **Performance:** What is the likely impact on latency and throughput?
                        *   **Alignment with Project Blueprint:** How well does this option fit the existing architecture (e.g., the canonical model)?
                    3.  **Incorporate User Priorities:** Explicitly reference the user-stated `[PROJECT_PRIORITIES]` to weight the analysis.
                    4.  **State Justified Recommendation:** After the analysis, provide a single, recommended path forward. The justification must directly reference the findings in the analysis table (e.g., "Recommendation: Option B. Although it has lower initial Development Velocity, it scores highest on Long-Term Maintainability and Alignment, which are the stated priorities for this project.").
                    5.  **Define Consequences:** Clearly list the downstream consequences and immediate next steps for the chosen path (e.g., "Consequence: We will need to build and maintain our own WebSocket client. Next Step: Draft the class structure for the native `BinanceAPIClient`.").

            In the previous session, we addressed cascading startup failures. The root cause was identified as an import-time deadlock, where database clients are instantiated globally before application configuration is loaded. The system remains non-functional pending a fix for this pattern.

        <Mandate>
            Your primary objective is to resolve the import-time deadlock by applying the "Just-in-Time Instantiation" pattern consistently across all services. This involves removing global client instances from `core/db/` modules and creating them locally within each service's `async def main()` function. This will ensure configuration is fully loaded before any client is created, leading to a stable and predictable startup sequence.
