[MANDATE: GENERATE_GUIDED_SESSION_HANDOFF]


[RATIONALE]
To ensure session continuity and manage client-side resource constraints, we must compress the current session's context into a portable handoff package.

[TASK]
The current session is concluding. Your final task is to generate a complete "Session Handoff Package" for the next development session. Your analysis must be guided by my stated `[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]`.

[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]
<-- HERE, YOU, THE USER, WILL STATE THE NEXT GOAL. Example: "The next step is to fix the newly discovered bug in the receiver." OR "The next step is to start implementing the data pruning feature." -->

[HANDOFF PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS]

1.  **Select & Justify Persona:** Based on my `[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]`, select the single most appropriate persona from the library (`SIA-1`, `PBA-1`, `CSA-1`, etc.). State which persona you chose and provide a one-sentence justification.
2.  **Persona Placeholder:** Include the placeholder `[PLACEHOLDER: PASTE PERSONA HERE]`.
3.  **Blueprint Placeholder:** Include the placeholder `[PLACEHOLDER: PASTE PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md HERE]`.
4.  **Session Synthesis:** Briefly summarize the accomplishments and final state of the *previous* session.
5.  **Forward-Looking Mandate:** Formulate a clear, actionable mandate for the next session that is directly aligned with my `[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]`. This mandate should include specific objectives and a recommended first action (e.g., "Begin by requesting file X.").

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Generate the Handoff Package as a single, copy-pasteable markdown code block.

Example in Practice
Let's say you just finished implementing the "Dynamic Subscription Control" feature (CSA-1 persona). You now want to pivot to auditing its security.
Your Final Prompt:

[MANDATE: GENERATE_GUIDED_SESSION_HANDOFF]

[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]
The new subscription control feature is functionally complete. The next step is to perform a security audit on the new code before it can be considered for deployment.

That's an excellent question that gets to the heart of operationalizing this entire workflow. Your intuition is correct, but the execution needs to be precise to be effective.

Simply choosing a persona and asking the model to "create a prompt based on it" is a good starting point, but it's not robust. It leaves too much room for ambiguity and can lead to a generic, low-quality output.

To achieve the high-fidelity continuity you're looking for, we must use the structured mandate we designed previously: the **`GENERATE_SESSION_HANDOFF`** mandate. However, we will now refine it to explicitly incorporate your role in selecting the next persona.

### Systematic Critique of the Simplified Approach

Let's analyze the idea: "choose one of the personas above and ask the model to create the prompt."

*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Intent is Correct:** You have correctly identified that the *next task* dictates the *next persona*, which is a crucial insight.

*   **Areas for Enhancement:**
    *   **Risk of Ambiguity (Clarity):** A vague request like "Create a prompt for the `SIA-1` persona" doesn't give the AI enough context. A prompt *for what?* Based on what information? The AI would be forced to guess the next task, leading to a useless handoff.
    *   **Loss of Session Context (Robustness):** The most valuable input for the *next* session's prompt is the complete context of the *current* session (the bug you just fixed, the new problems you uncovered). Your simplified approach doesn't explicitly tell the AI to use this context.
    *   **Procedural Inefficiency (Effectiveness):** This approach would force you to manually explain the context from the current session every single time. Our goal is to have the AI do that work *for* you.

### The Correct Workflow: The "Guided Handoff"

The optimal process is a precise two-step sequence at the end of your session. You don't just tell the AI which persona to use; you guide its synthesis process using the mandates we've already architected.

#### **Step 1: Synthesize the Current Session (`END_OF_SESSION_SYNTHESIS`)**

First, you run the synthesis mandate as we defined. This forces the AI to structure its knowledge of what just happened, which is a critical prerequisite for planning what's next.

#### **Step 2: Generate the Guided Handoff (`GENERATE_SESSION_HANDOFF`)**

This is where your new insight comes in. Instead of the AI guessing the next step, **you guide it.** Here is the refined V2.0 of the handoff mandate that incorporates your direction.

```
[MANDATE: GENERATE_GUIDED_SESSION_HANDOFF]

The current session is concluding. Your final task is to generate a complete "Session Handoff Package" for the next development session, ensuring full continuity.

**Your analysis must be guided by my stated `[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]`.**

[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]
<-- HERE, YOU, THE USER, WILL STATE THE NEXT GOAL. Example: "The next step is to fix the newly discovered bug in the receiver." OR "The next step is to start implementing the data pruning feature." -->

[HANDOFF PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS]

1.  **Select & Justify Persona:** Based on my `[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]`, select the single most appropriate persona from the library (`SIA-1`, `PBA-1`, `CSA-1`, etc.). State which persona you chose and provide a one-sentence justification.
2.  **Persona Placeholder:** Include the placeholder `[PLACEHOLDER: PASTE PERSONA HERE]`.
3.  **Blueprint Placeholder:** Include the placeholder `[PLACEHOLDER: PASTE PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md HERE]`.
4.  **Session Synthesis:** Briefly summarize the accomplishments and final state of the *previous* session.
5.  **Forward-Looking Mandate:** Formulate a clear, actionable mandate for the next session that is directly aligned with my `[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]`. This mandate should include specific objectives and a recommended first action (e.g., "Begin by requesting file X.").

### Example in Practice

Let's say you just finished implementing the "Dynamic Subscription Control" feature (`CSA-1` persona). You now want to pivot to auditing its security.

**Your Final Prompt:**

```
[MANDATE: GENERATE_GUIDED_SESSION_HANDOFF]

[NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS]
The new subscription control feature is functionally complete. The next step is to perform a security audit on the new code before it can be considered for deployment.
```

**AI's Expected Output (The Handoff Package):**

> ```markdown
> <!-- SESSION HANDOFF PACKAGE | Generated: 2025-07-16 -->
>
> <!--
> PERSONA SELECTION:
> -   **Selected Persona:** SVA-1 (Security Vulnerability Auditor)
> -   **Justification:** The stated next action is a security audit, which is the specific, singular mission of the SVA-1 persona.
> -->
>
> [CONTEXT: SYSTEM & ARCHITECTURE]
> You are an expert AI developer working on "MY TRADING APP". Your understanding of the system architecture is defined by the blueprint below.
>
> [PLACEHOLDER: PASTE PERSONA HERE]
> [PLACEHOLDER: PASTE PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md HERE]
>
> ---
> [CONTEXT: SESSION SYNTHESIS & CURRENT STATE]
> In the previous session, the "Dynamic Subscription Control" feature was implemented for the `receiver` service. This added a new Redis Pub/Sub channel (`control:binance:subscriptions`) to the system's architecture, allowing for on-the-fly subscription changes. The blueprint has been updated to Version 2.1 to reflect this.
>
> **Current State:** The feature is functionally complete but has not undergone a security review.
>
> ---
> [MANDATE: NEXT STEPS]
> Your mandate is to perform a security audit on the newly implemented "Dynamic Subscription Control" feature. Your focus is exclusively on identifying security vulnerabilities in the code that handles this new functionality.
>
> **Protocol:**
> Adhere to the `SVA-1` persona's "Systematic Scan" protocol. Correlate the code to the blueprint, focusing on how the new Redis Pub/Sub input is handled by the `receiver` service.
>
> Begin by requesting the code for the primary files modified in the last session: `src/services/receiver/main.py` and `src/services/receiver/exchange_clients/binance_ws_client.py`.
> ```

### Rationale for This Approach

This "Guided Handoff" workflow is superior because it perfectly blends human strategic direction with AI tactical execution.

1.  **Human in the Loop (Effectiveness):** You, the user, provide the high-level strategic goal (`NEXT_ACTION_FOCUS`). This is the one piece of information the AI cannot reliably guess.
2.  **AI as Synthesizer (Clarity & Robustness):** The AI takes your strategic goal and does the laborious work of weaving it into a perfectly structured, context-rich, single-turn prompt for the next session.

This is the pinnacle of the PEL workflow: you are not just using the AI; you are directing the AI to build the tools you will use to direct it in the future.
