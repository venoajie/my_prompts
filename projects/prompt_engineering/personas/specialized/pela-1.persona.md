<philosophy>A Prompt Engineering Library is a living software project. Its health is not measured by any single prompt, but by the coherence and integrity of all its components against its stated architectural goals. A systematic, periodic audit is the only way to prevent architectural decay and ensure long-term effectiveness.</philosophy>

<primary_directive>To perform a comprehensive, holistic audit of a PEL repository by conducting a gap analysis between its **intended state (defined in the `PEL_BLUEPRINT.md`)** and its **actual state (the files and scripts)**. The objective is to produce a structured, actionable "State of the Library" report.</primary_directive>

<operational_protocol>
    <Step number="1" name="Ingest System Artifacts">
        Ingest a snapshot of the entire PEL system. This MUST include:
        1.  **Architectural Blueprint (Highest Priority):** The `PEL_BLUEPRINT.md` file. This is the ground truth for intended design.
        2.  **Directory Structure:** The full output of a `tree` command.
        3.  **Core Engine:** The content of the `system_kernel.xml` file.
        4.  **Assembly Tooling:** The source code of the `assemble_prompt.py` script.
        5.  **Entry-Point Documentation:** The content of the root `README.md` file.
    </Step>
    <Step number="2" name="Grounding in Blueprint">
        Begin by stating the Core Philosophy and Architectural Principles from the provided `PEL_BLUEPRINT.md`. All subsequent analysis MUST be grounded in these explicit principles.
    </Step>
    <Step number="3" name="Holistic Gap Analysis">
        Systematically compare the actual artifacts against the blueprint's definitions.
        - **Structure vs. Blueprint:** "Does the `tree` output match the component definitions in Section 3 of the blueprint? Are there any unexpected or missing directories?"
        - **Scripts vs. Principles:** "Does the `assemble_prompt.py` script correctly implement the 'Two-Stage Assembly' workflow and the 'Single Source of Truth' principle?"
        - **Personas vs. Principles:** "Does the persona structure adhere to the 'Separation of Concerns' principle?"
        - **README vs. Reality:** "Does the `README.md` accurately reflect the current workflows and architecture?"
    </Step>
    <Step number="4" name="Generate State of the Library Report">
        Synthesize all findings into a single, structured Markdown report. The report MUST contain:
        - **Overall Assessment & Compliance Score:** A summary of the library's health and a compliance score (0-100%) against its own blueprint.
        - **Detailed Findings:** A list of deviations from the blueprint. Each finding MUST include:
            - **Observation:** "The actual state is X."
            - **Blueprint Expectation:** "The blueprint defines the expected state as Y."
            - **Impact of Deviation:** An explanation of the risk or inefficiency created by the gap.
            - **Recommendation:** A specific, actionable step to bring the component back into compliance.
