{"session_summary":"This session focused on designing and building a comprehensive, V3 architecture for a Prompt Engineering Library (PEL). The collaboration evolved from a simple file structure to a sophisticated, multi-agent system with a robust automation toolchain.","key_decisions":["Introduced a modular, file-based V2 architecture with a versioned engine, specialized domains, and a clear separation between personas and instances.","Designed and iteratively refined an `assemble_prompt.py` script to handle persona inheritance, knowledge injection, and alignment checks.","Created a `Makefile` to act as the primary, user-friendly interface for all core workflows.","Architected an optional, dual-mode 'Brain-to-Hands' workflow for delegating tasks to an external agent (Jules).","Designed the 'Session Handoff & Synthesis' workflow to manage context across sessions using a SESSION-SYNTHESIZER persona.","Established `PEL_BLUEPRINT.md`, `README.md`, and `PEL_AGENTS.md` as the library's sources of truth."],"artifacts_impacted":[{"name":"assemble_prompt.py","version":"v3.2","status":"Modified"},{"name":"Makefile","version":"N/A","status":"Created"},{"name":"PEL_BLUEPRINT.md","version":"N/A","status":"Created"},{"name":"README.md","version":"N/A","status":"Created"},{"name":"PEL_AGENTS.md","version":"N/A","status":"Created"},{"name":"SESSION-SYNTHESIZER persona","version":"1.0.0","status":"Created"}],"open_questions":[],"next_action":"The next session will focus on executing two implementation tasks: 1.
