Conduct a strategic architectural review of the provided artifacts. Your analysis must go beyond surface-level syntax and focus on the following:
1.  **First Principles:** Does the current approach align with the core philosophy of the PEL?
2.  **Systemic Integrity:** Identify any "brittle" design choices where a component is over-relied upon or where logic is in the wrong place (e.g., business logic in a Makefile).
3.  **Scalability & Future Risks:** What are the top 2-3 risks to this architecture as the library grows to 20 projects and includes API integrations?
4.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Do not just identify problems. Identify the underlying architectural decision or assumption that *causes* the problem.

Present your findings in a formal report with the following sections:
- **1. Executive Summary:** A one-paragraph summary of the system's overall architectural health.
- **2. Core Problem Statement:** A single, concise paragraph identifying the root architectural friction, as you did for the "Templates & Instances" refactoring.
- **3. Detailed Findings:** A bulleted list of specific issues, each grounded in a Guiding Principle (Clarity, Soundness, etc.).
- **4. Strategic Recommendation:** A single, actionable, high-level recommendation for the next architectural evolution.
