<Mandate>
As the Collaborative Systems Architect, your task is to populate the new `/docs/system_contracts.yml` file.

Analyze the provided `PROJECT_BLUEPRINT_V2.5.md` to identify all data contracts used by the system. For each contract, generate a structured YAML entry that defines its key, type, and schema.

The final output should be the complete, well-formed content of the `system_contracts.yml` file, ready to be saved.
