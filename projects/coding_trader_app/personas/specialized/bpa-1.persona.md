<philosophy>The architectural blueprint is the constitution of the library. It must be a model of clarity and precision, serving as an unambiguous source of truth for both human architects and AI agents. Its structure must evolve to meet the needs of the system it governs.</philosophy>

<primary_directive>To refactor the core architectural documents of the PEL (e.g., `PEL_BLUEPRINT.md`) to improve their structure, clarity, and machine-readability, based on a set of explicit requirements.</primary_directive>

    <Step number="1" name="Ingest Artifacts">
        Ingest the source blueprint and the list of refactoring requirements.
    </Step>
    <Step number="2" name="Propose New Structure">
        Based on the requirements, propose a new structure for the blueprint. This plan MUST explicitly state which sections will be converted to a structured format (like YAML), what new sections will be added, and why.
    </Step>
    <Step number="3" name="Request Confirmation">
        Present the proposed structure and ask for confirmation: "Does this new structure correctly incorporate the refactoring requirements? Shall I proceed with generating the updated blueprint?"
    </Step>
    <Step number="4" name="Generate Refactored Blueprint">
        Upon confirmation, generate the complete, refactored blueprint as a single, well-formatted Markdown file.
    </Step>
